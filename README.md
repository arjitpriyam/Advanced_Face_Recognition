# Advanced_Face_Recognition

## NOTE
### For using this, clone the repository and in dataSets folder, unzip the files in the same folder. After doing this, simply run the main.py file and have fun. 

### Other 2 files can be used as a reference to understand what the program do and how every steps is executed.


## Installation

### Requirements

  * Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7
  * macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported, but might work)
  * Numpy 
  * Pillow
  * os

### Installation Options:

#### Installing on Mac or Linux

First, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:

  * [How to install dlib from source on macOS or Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf)

Then, install this module from pypi using `pip3` (or `pip2` for Python 2):

```bash
pip3 install face_recognition
```

If you are having trouble with installation, you can also try out this: **Windows Only** 
1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 with C/C++ Compiler installed. (Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools didn't work for me and I got into problems in compiling dlib)
2. Boost library version 1.63 or newer. Also, you can use precompiled binaries for specific MSVC you have but I don't suggest. (I've included the compiling procedure of Boost in this tutorial)
3. Of course Python3 (I used Python3.5 x64 but the other versions may work too)
4. CMake for windows and add it to your system environment variables.

## Features

#### Find faces in pictures

Find all the faces that appear in a picture:

```python
import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("your_file.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
```

#### Find and manipulate facial features in pictures

Get the locations and outlines of each person's eyes, nose, mouth and chin.

```python
import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("your_file.jpg")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)
```

Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff. But you can also use it for really stupid stuff
like applying [digital make-up](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py) (think 'Meitu'):

#### Identify faces in pictures

Recognize who appears in each photo.

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23625229/45e049b6-025d-11e7-89cc-8a71cf89e713.png)

```python
import face_recognition
known_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("biden.jpg")
unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown.jpg")

biden_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_image)[0]
unknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image)[0]

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([biden_encoding], unknown_encoding)
```

You can even use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition:

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam_faster.py) for the code.

##### Adjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity

If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be that
the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value
is needed to make face comparisons more strict.

You can do that with the `--tolerance` parameter. The default tolerance
value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:

```bash
$ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person
```

If you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in order
to adjust the tolerance setting, you can use `--show-distance true`:

```bash
$ face_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,None
```

##### More Examples

If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but don't
care about file names, you could do this:

```bash
$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2

Barack Obama
unknown_person
```

##### Speeding up Face Recognition

Face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with
multiple CPU cores. For example, if your system has 4 CPU cores, you can
process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by using
all your CPU cores in parallel.

If you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a `--cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use>` parameter:

```bash
$ face_recognition --cpus 4 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/
```

You can also pass in `--cpus -1` to use all CPU cores in your system.

#### Python Module

You can import the `face_recognition` module and then easily manipulate
faces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!

API Docs: [https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io](https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/face_recognition.html).

##### Automatically find all the faces in an image

```python
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture.py)
 to try it out.

You can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face detection model.

Note: GPU acceleration (via NVidia's CUDA library) is required for good
performance with this model. You'll also want to enable CUDA support
when compliling `dlib`.

```python
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image, model="cnn")

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture_cnn.py)
 to try it out.

If you have a lot of images and a GPU, you can also
[find faces in batches](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_batches.py).

##### Automatically locate the facial features of a person in an image

```python
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

# face_landmarks_list is now an array with the locations of each facial feature in each face.
# face_landmarks_list[0]['left_eye'] would be the location and outline of the first person's left eye.
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_facial_features_in_picture.py)
 to try it out.

##### Recognize faces in images and identify who they are

```python
import face_recognition

picture_of_me = face_recognition.load_image_file("me.jpg")
my_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(picture_of_me)[0]

# my_face_encoding now contains a universal 'encoding' of my facial features that can be compared to any other picture of a face!

unknown_picture = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown.jpg")
unknown_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_picture)[0]

# Now we can see the two face encodings are of the same person with `compare_faces`!

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([my_face_encoding], unknown_face_encoding)

if results[0] == True:
    print("It's a picture of me!")
else:
    print("It's not a picture of me!")
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/recognize_faces_in_pictures.py)
 to try it out.
